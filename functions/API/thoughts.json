    "content": "Boy do I have a story to tell.  You know how I was keeping track of Michael\u2019s safe combo?  Well it finally came in handy.  I was trolling around the office last night after hours and heard some noise coming from the boss\u2019s room.  Normally the office is real quiet at night, which is why I stick around in the first place.  Quiet is like a drug to me and if I don\u2019t get my fix every night, I start to get the shakes.  \n\nSo anyway, I heard these noises and got freaked out that the bossman was using his office for a little nighttime nooky with that new chick that sits in Tony\u2019s seat every day.  Not wanting to get caught, I dropped down and started to army crawl over to investigate (I got a Private Investigator license so I\u2019m allowed to investigate anything I want, suckers).  As luck would have it, there wasn\u2019t anybody in there.  Turns out that the noise was coming from inside Michael\u2019s big furniture cabinet thing.  So I opened the cabinet door, half expecting a cat to jump out at me.  Usually when I open cabinets or closets or anything, cats end up pouncing on me.  For some reason, cats find me very attractive.\n\nNothing jumped out at me, but I could hear the rustling pretty close to the ground, so I bent over and figured out that it was coming from the safe.  For a second, I just stared at it, wondering what could be inside.  Then I realized that I had been saving up Michael\u2019s safe combo for this very occasion.  Well, this occasion and whenever I needed some cash, but that\u2019s beside the point.  \n\nI went over to my computer and looked back at my previous entries of this thing.  Apparently I wasn\u2019t too good with my record keeping because the numbers were kind of off.  I ended up trying out every combo I wrote down and you know what?  I didn\u2019t get it right until the very last one I tried.  The good news is, I got it open and you\u2019ll never guess what was inside.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t a cat, smart ass.  It was a squirrel!  I don\u2019t know for the life of me why that guy had a squirrel in his safe, but I do know that I got me a new pet.  And I\u2019m going to train it.  Right now I\u2019m calling it Butthead, but I\u2019m open to suggestions for new names if you got any.  In just a few months, I\u2019m going to have the best trained squirrel in Pennsylvania.  I\u2019m also going to blackmail Michael because I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s against the law to lock a squirrel in a safe.  False imprisonment or something.\n\nEverything\u2019s coming up Creed!"

    "content": "I want to say I was about four years old when I fell in love with music.  My memory\u2019s not great, so it could have been anywhere between four and fourteen, but I think it was closer to four.  I was hanging out in an old abandoned car factory in South Carolina and I came across a bunch of old bumpers lying on the ground.  At that age, I used to walk around with a bunch of sticks in my back pocket in case I ever needed something to throw.  When I saw those bumpers, I don\u2019t know what came over me, but I knew that I had to take out a pair of sticks and start banging away.\n\nFrom the instant my sticks hit that metal, I was hooked.  I pounded out beat after beat, dancing and singing along.  I loved it.  The music jumped into my body like a venereal disease from a hooker.  I stayed in that factory for hours and hours just banging away.  The next day, I came back and started right up where I left off.  I made up songs about everything: jump ropes, corn, beaver skin hats.  Nothing was off limits.\n\nAbout a week later, I saw an old man playing a beat-up guitar on the street.  I watched him for a while, trying to learn what he was doing as I stood there.  After about an hour, he said he had to go to the can and asked me to watch his instrument.  I gladly agreed.  When he left to go to the bathroom, I snatched the guitar and ran all the way to the factory.  It was the first thing I had ever stolen and on that day, I said to myself \u201cMusic and thieving are going to be the biggest things in your life\u201d and you know what?  They still are.\n\nMusic has been a part of me ever since.  Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t tap out a rhythm or pick up my axe and play a lick or two.  If you cut open my veins, I\u2019m fairly certain that quarter notes would come tumbling out.  I can\u2019t imagine my life without music and I don\u2019t want to.  "

    "content": "I spend a lot of time in the library.  Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m not there for the books.  Books are for table balancing and throwing at birds.  I go for the air conditioning and the smell.  Libraries smell good.  It almost makes me want to like books, but not quite.  Anyway, there\u2019re a lot of kids at the library -- maybe it\u2019s summer school or something \u2013 and these kids talk like I\u2019ve never heard before.  It\u2019s like a secret street language and I want in.  They say stuff like \u201cthat dude got clowned\u201d and \u201che got that swag when he walks.\u201d I want to know what the hell these kids are talking about, but they won\u2019t tell me.  I\u2019ve tried going up to the kids to talk about the phrases, but they get kind of freaked out by me.  Just wait until they need an ID \u2013 then we\u2019ll see who\u2019s running away and telling the librarians.\n\nAnyway, those jerks won\u2019t tell me anything, so I\u2019m making up my own words and phrases.  This is my street dictionary and I\u2019m not even charging for it.  Just don\u2019t tell the kids in the library, okay?\n\nKeep it bowlin\u2019 \u2013 Everyone likes bowling, so this is a phrase for when you want to tell someone to stay positive.  For example, if someone tells you they lost their job, you can just tell them to keep it bowlin\u2019 and that\u2019ll cheer them up.\n\nPloppers \u2013 This means bad.  \u201cDid you see that movie last night?  It was ploppers.\u201d\n\nHorribly obese \u2013 I\u2019m taking this one from the library kids.  They say things are fat all the time, so I took it a step further.  In this case, it means the most beautiful ever.  If a foxy dame comes walking in, you can call her horribly obese.  I think it might take some time before it catches on, so use this one with caution because some broads may not have heard it yet and could take it the wrong way.\n\nWilly fingers \u2013 Perhaps the hardest to explain, but you get willy fingers when you really want to fight someone.  \u201cWhen my boss was yelling at me, I really started getting willy fingers.\u201d  Your fingers start moving real fast and itching because they want to hit something \u2013 that\u2019s the willy fingers.\n\nThose kids are going to regret not letting me in on their lingo.  My slang\u2019s going to take over the nation and there\u2019s nothing those idiots can do to stop it.  Keep it bowlin\u2019, people."

    "content": "We\u2019re having a party at work tomorrow to celebrate \u201c08/08/08 Day,\u201d which is great because I\u2019ll be able to eat enough that I won\u2019t have to buy food for a week.  That\u2019s my favorite part about work parties \u2013 they end up saving me a lot of moolah in the long run.  I wish they were more fun, though.  If I was in charge, we\u2019d be rocking and rolling all night.  My parties would go down in history as the best work parties of all time.  Here\u2019s a rundown of my perfect party:\n\nWe\u2019d start out with a bang, and by that I mean I\u2019d fire off a starter\u2019s pistol so people knew the party actually started.  The very first event of the party would be Bobbing for Creed Shots.  I\u2019d fill a large kiddie pool with Creed Juice -- a mixture of kool-aid, Pop Rocks, and grain alcohol -- and throw some shot glasses in there.  Then everyone has to lean in, grab a shot glass with their mouths, and take the shot.  It\u2019s messy but it sure gets things started right.  If you\u2019re not drunk after Bobbing for Creed Shots, you\u2019re not playing right.\n\nSo after everyone\u2019s good and sauced up, I\u2019d break out the pi\u00f1atas.  The key to pi\u00f1atas at parties is naming them.  If you name them after co-workers, you know people are going to really get into it.  I\u2019m not so great with names, so I\u2019d let somebody else do the naming, but trust me, they would all be named.  As for filling them, that all depends on the budget.  If there\u2019s no dinero for the pi\u00f1atas, then I\u2019d fill them with dry rice.  If there\u2019s a little cash around, then I\u2019d go for hard candy.  With hard candy, you get the fun of seeing the pi\u00f1ata burst AND the injuries that go with it.\n\nAfter pi\u00f1ata time, we\u2019d go straight into the eating contests.  I\u2019m partial to deviled eggs for quantity, but I know hot dogs are pretty popular these days, too.  I\u2019d compromise and make hot dog omelets for everyone to scarf down.  I\u2019m pretty sure I know who\u2019d win, but you never can tell \u2013 sometimes the smallest accountants make the biggest eaters.\n\nWhen the party winds down, I\u2019d do another round of Bobbing for Creed Shots and then send people on their way with Goody Bags.  The bags would just be filled with office supplies, but hey, everyone likes a parting gift, right?\n\nThey should really make me head of that party committee thing.  I\u2019d be amazing."

I think the real challenge is sleeping in a bed filled with needles.  You just know that\u2019s not gonna end well.\n\nI\u2019ve gone for rolls in the hay and it is nothing like sex.\n\nSometimes I\u2019ll do shots of mouthwash.  It gets me a little tipsy and gives me great breath.\n\nI think baseball should introduce a longstop position, just in case the shortstop misses the ball.\n\nWho decided that we needed both North and South Dakota.  It seems like a lot of wasted paperwork to me.\n\nCatching flies with your hands is fun, but catching frogs with your feet is a lot more satisfying.\n\nI like to wear two undershirts most days because you never know when you\u2019ll walk into a strip poker game. \n\nI want to open up a bar called \u201cCreed\u2019s Meads\u201d and bring mead back to how popular it was during the American Revolution.

Sure, they have a 99% chance of knowing that you\u2019re not Batman, but it\u2019s that 1% that gives you the in.\n\nWhat you\u2019re really looking for is the lady that wants to argue with you about how much you\u2019re not Batman.  Those are the broads that end up in bed with you later on yelling \u201cYes, Batman!  Show me your utility belt!\u201d  It works every time.  It also helps to have a utility belt with you because up until that point, she may still not believe you\u2019re Batman, but when you produce the utility belt, you send her head spinning.\n\nI never used to be good at pick-up lines because I was too direct.  \u201cI\u2019d like to be your blanket\u201d works on some chicks, but most of them just slap you and walk away.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a good slapping.  It\u2019s good for the skin and makes you focus on the task at hand.  I\u2019d just rather talk to the woman than get slapped, that\u2019s all.  So I had to take a different approach.  I\u2019ve heard of new dating advice books where you\u2019re supposed to insult a girl to get her attention, but I think that\u2019s the wrong approach.  If I\u2019m not pretending to be Batman, I like to use really impressive facts to get them to talk to me.\n\nI\u2019ll pick out the hottest lady in the bar (or zoo or botanical garden or wherever else I might happen to be) and get her attention with a really loud whisper.  Women respond really well to whispers.  It\u2019s because they like secrets.  So I\u2019ll whisper, \u201cHey you, come over here\u201d and I\u2019ll look like I\u2019ve got a real big secret to tell them.  When they come over, I reach into my bag of facts (not literally) and pull out a good one.  \u201cDolphins are the only animals besides humans that copulate for pleasure.\u201d  It works like a charm.  Most of the time.  Not really.  It gets me slapped less, though, so I\u2019m sticking with it."

    "content": "I\u2019ve always liked uniforms.  When I was a kid, I wore sailor suits every day until I was eight.  People called me Captain Crapstick because of how I dressed and the fact that I would carry around a stick with me that I used for poking all sorts of crap.  I still have my sailor suit hanging proudly in my closet, but I only break it out when a special lady comes over.  It doesn\u2019t fit so well anymore, but I still look darn cute in it.\n\nIn my opinion, every job should have a uniform.  Fast-food workers, gas station attendants, exterminators, these guys all have it covered already.  I\u2019m pushing for the jobs that make you waste time every morning decided what to wear.  Take my job, for instance.  I know I\u2019m not allowed to wear shorts, because every time I do, I get yelled at.  I also can\u2019t wear vests without shirts underneath.  So I\u2019m locked into wearing a certain combination of clothing every day, but there are just too many choices.  If it were up to me, I\u2019d implement an office worker uniform so you could just wake up every morning, go to your uniform closet, and three seconds later you\u2019re all set.\n\nMy uniform would consist of three items and three items only.  \n\n1. Navy blue sweatpants.  These are the first item because they\u2019re the most important.  When I go home, the first thing I do is put on navy blue sweatpants.  You can\u2019t find a more comfortable piece of clothing.  The color is great because you can spill all you want and nobody\u2019s the wiser.  All in all, if the uniform doesn\u2019t include navy blue sweatpants, I don\u2019t want the job. \n\n2. A vest.  No shirt required.  Vests are amazing inventions.  They cover up your nipples (which society has decided are unacceptable to see, for some reason) and they\u2019re classy.  You want to class up a joint?  Throw on a vest.  You want to add some more class?  Make sure that vest is leather.\n\n3. Comfy slippers.  Right after I change into my navy blue sweatpants, I slide on my sheepskin-lined slippers.  Talk about comfort!  These little puppies make it feel like you\u2019re walking on a field of soft paralyzed sheep \u2013 I say paralyzed only so you don\u2019t picture the sheep as moving.  If I could wear slippers to work every day, I\u2019d probably start caring about my job.\n\nThese three items could change the workplace as we know it.  I\u2019m serious, America.  Just think about how much more productive we would be as a country if all office-workers wore navy blue sweatpants, vests without shirts, and comfy slippers.  We\u2019d be a comfortably dressed productivity superpower, and honestly, isn\u2019t that what all this fighting is about anyway?"

I\u2019ve never actually sliced into any rugs, but I bet I\u2019d be pretty good at that, too, considering how handy I am with knives.  \n\nI can cut a rug in the sense that I can dance like a mofo.  Ever since I was little, I\u2019ve had rhythm in me.  Everyone used to call me Lil\u2019 Josephine Baker because I liked to shake it everywhere I went, plus I once made a skirt out of bananas.  My favorite place to hoof it was the market.  One time, I was dancing up a storm in the produce section and I knocked into a huge display of apples.  Those Red Delicious came tumbling down, but that didn\u2019t stop little Creedy.  No sir.  I just kept on twirling and juking and the apples became my dance floor.  When I was finished, the whole store applauded, except for the manager, who called the police.\n\nNot to toot my own horn or anything, especially because my horn is pretty dusty and might make everyone sick if I tooted it, but I\u2019m pretty sure I invented break dancing.  I used to have my neighbor bang out a beat on his kick drum while I tried to spin around on my back.  At the time, I did it to get dizzy.  In retrospect, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that I was inventing a new style of dance.\n\nI\u2019ve got a pair of dancing shoes that are made out of magic.  They\u2019ve got a black and white checker pattern on them and I bought them from a Serbian flutist who needed some cash to get his flute out of hock.  From the minute I put them on, I felt like my feet had a mind of their own.  They just tap-tap-tap to their own beat and I do my best to keep up.  For a while, I thought the guy put Mexican jumping beans in the heels, but I checked and there aren\u2019t any beans in those shoes.  Not unless I decide to put them there and, as of right now, I have no interest in doing so. \n\nThe only place I won\u2019t dance for fun is on people\u2019s graves.  I dance on people\u2019s graves for disrespect purposes only and nothing more."

You can do twice the damage with it.\n\nI believe the children are our future.  Specifically Chinese children.\n\nGambling for money is fun, but gambling for livestock is so much better.  If you end up winning, you get the satisfaction of victory and a ride home.\n\nI like to tell time using the sun.  If it\u2019s sunny, then it\u2019s time for work.  If it\u2019s dark, then it\u2019s time to make money.\n\nGlobes are great for hiding stuff.  Nobody ever bothers to look inside a globe, and if they do, they\u2019re probably really weak anyway, so you can just beat them up and run away.\n\nNever talk to men with red hair.  They live by different rules than you or I.  There\u2019s a reason all the famous clowns have red hair and it\u2019s not because red is a friendly hair color.\n\nI\u2019ve been running a lot lately and I\u2019m getting into really good shape.  Of course, it really helps that I\u2019m carrying a lot of loot while I run.\n\nWhen I\u2019m in a new situation, I tell everyone it\u2019s my birthday.  People really treat you better when they think it\u2019s your birthday, whether they know you or not.\n\nI hate waiting.  It drives me nutso.  If I\u2019m at a drive-thru window and it\u2019s taking too long to get my food, I\u2019ll just get out of my car and go for a walk for half an hour.  When I get back, I\u2019m much calmer and the fast food joint gets an important message about wasting people\u2019s time.\n\nI carry a salt shaker in my pocket because you never know when you\u2019ll need to teach a slug a lesson.\n\n\nReminder: Michael\u2019s safe combo: 86-7-53-09"

It\u2019s terrible and I mean really awful.  It smells a little like a mix between very wet cats and regurgitated corn chips.  I don\u2019t know what\u2019s been causing it, but I need to find out because it\u2019s making me sick.\n\nHonestly, if I didn\u2019t have to smell it myself, I\u2019d be happy about it.  Gas is a powerful weapon.  You want some space to yourself?  Unload a popper and those seats next to you clear out real fast.  You want a day off of work?  Start a little seat orchestra and you\u2019ll be sent home in no time.  I wish I were back in my twenties when I couldn\u2019t smell anything because then I\u2019d have some fun with these stinkbombs.  Sadly, every time I let one go, I\u2019m my own first victim.\n\nI end up being victim to myself a lot.  That\u2019s what happens when you do a lot of home chemical mixing.  It started out as a hobby, but I\u2019ve really stepped up my game in the last few years.  I\u2019m trying to find a chemical cure for wrinkles, but it\u2019s not going so well.  I have, however, invented quite a few potions for giving yourself rashes.  When rashes come back into \u201cvogue,\u201d I\u2019ll be the king of the rash world.\n\nRash World sounds like a really fun theme park, don\u2019t you think?  I\u2019d visit, as long as the admission price wasn\u2019t too high.  I wonder if they have funnel cakes at Rash World.  Funnel cakes are incredible.  They\u2019re my favorite fried batter-based cake.\n\nOther types of cakes that I enjoy: snack cakes, birthday cakes, coffee cakes, tea cakes, ice cream cakes, urinal cakes, erotic cakes, layer cakes, hot cakes, and wedding cakes.  Cakes that I do not enjoy: cupcakes.  Why waste my time on a cupcake when I can get the real deal?  Cupcakes should only be eaten in times of war or famine.  Or when they\u2019re filled with cream.  That\u2019s it."

Who can afford to drink more than one a day?  Certainly not me.  My money goes to more enterprising pursuits, like laminating equipment and buying ladies drinks.  I wish I could drink six or seven cans of the stuff a day to keep me going, but until I win the lottery, that\u2019s not happening.  When I was in the convenience store the other day, though, I saw this new energy drink called VivaMaxxPlus, so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nLet me tell you, that stuff is amazing.  They\u2019re half the price of the Bull and they get my heart going even faster.  It\u2019s incredible.  I drink a whole mess of them at lunchtime and then I\u2019m awake until the sun comes up.  It really helps me get through the workday and then my real workday, which starts at around 10pm.  It\u2019s hard to explain the feeling I get, but it\u2019s like someone hooked up a battery to my body and it\u2019s in charge of making my blood flow, but the dial that controls the speed got messed up and it\u2019s stuck on \u201csuper fast.\u201d  That\u2019s exactly what it feels like.  That, or stepping on an exposed wire at a construction site where you\u2019re trying to scam some copper late at night.  I know what that feels like and VivaMaxxPlus is pretty similar.  \n\nI decided I have to limit myself to three or four a day or else I\u2019m going to get in some real trouble.  Any more than that and I get pretty aggressive.  Last week, I drank five cans of the sauce and when this new lady started questioning me about what I did at work, I freaked out.  I started imagining me and her on a go-kart track, but she didn\u2019t have a go-kart and my go-kart had all kinds of James Bond spy weapons on it.  Right when I started picturing myself shooting her with my dashboard missiles, I realized I needed to take it down a notch.  I\u2019m not a violent person, but there\u2019s something in that VivaMaxxPlus that makes me craaaaaaazy.\n\nI wonder if they sell a decaf version\u2026"

It might have been all of the ground-up tiger particles that were supposed to really jump-start your manhood, but who knows?

I think the boss man broke out his brass knuckles because I saw a lot of blood on the carpet the next day.  Blood on the carpet means trouble \u2013 that\u2019s a rule I live by.  I don\u2019t like fights at work, because it\u2019s too many parts of my life coming together in one place.  I prefer to keep fighting outside of work and my work out of fights.  This fight turned out pretty well for me, though, because everyone else got sent home so they could have a private cage match.\n\nThe first thing I did when we got sent home was head straight over to the mall for some orange chicken at the Lotus place.  That stuff is dynamite.  I could eat a shopping cart full of it.  Sadly, they don\u2019t sell it by the shopping cart, no matter how often I ask them to, so I settled for a combo meal.  There were a few high school kids in the food court, so I tried to drum up some new customers for my novelty identification and lamination business.  They weren\u2019t interested.  Apparently there\u2019s some punk over at Scranton Prep who does a really good Delaware now.  Even better than my Georgia.  I\u2019m going to track that kid down and have a \u201ctalk\u201d with him.

That place is like a zen garden to me.  I just sit down, grab a small ceramic elephant and go to town.  I can zone out for two, three hours painting that thing.  The best part about it is that when I\u2019m done, I get to take it with me.  You\u2019d be surprised how much you can get for an orange and green elephant when you tell people it\u2019s imported from Indonesia.\n\nI spent the rest of the night over at the grocery store sampling the candy in the bulk bins.

I found a dog that looked just like Bozo wandering around Wilkes-Barre over the weekend by herself and I immediately snatched her up.  You might think it\u2019s cruel to snatch a dog, but I say it\u2019s the only way.  I got a real big sack with breathing holes cut all over it and then I coaxed her to walk into it by throwing about fifteen hot dogs in there.  Once she was in the sack, I took her home with me and we\u2019ve been best friends ever since.  I\u2019ve been thinking about fitting her for a saddle since she\u2019s kind of big and I\u2019ve been meaning to start a doggy ride business for carnivals anyway.\n\nDoggy rides were one of my favorite childhood pastimes.  Pony rides and elephant rides seem to be the most popular form of animal rides, but doggy rides are a lot more fun.  They\u2019re like those mini-motorcycles that crazy idiots buy these days.  With a doggy ride, you never know where you\u2019re going to end up: The dogs might take off like jack-rabbits when they see something or the dogs could just plop down and take a rest.  We used to call those Sitsies.  You could never get a refund for a Sitsie, but you\u2019d always get a rain check.\n\nMy first step in dog ownership is training.  I\u2019ve already trained my pooch to relax, bark at the doorbell, and drink water.  Pretty soon we\u2019re going to work on pee in the house and growl.  She\u2019s super smart, so she\u2019s been picking everything up so quickly.  I really want to teach her to give me haircuts, but I\u2019ve had bad luck giving animals hair clippers recently.\n\nPicking a name is the most important part of getting a new dog.  With a girl dog, you\u2019ve got a few ways to go.  You can call her a traditional feminine name, like Molly or Annabelle, you can name her something that relates to the way she looks like Blackhead or Furry Paws, or you can name her based on something you really like.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling my dog \u201cHot.\u201d  I love hot dogs.  Always have, even in my vegetarian days.  Now that I have my own little hot dog running around with me, I\u2019ll be constantly reminded of her sausage-y goodness.  If you see Hot and me taking a stroll, come on over and say hi, but watch out.  I\u2019m in the middle of training her to bite strangers."

Clippers are great when you need to cut something, like a wire or a chain, and you don\u2019t want to be seen carrying something bigger.

Gauze is a great accessory.  If you get hurt, put gauze on it.  If you want to make people think that you\u2019re hurt, wrap a little gauze anywhere on your body and boom \u2013 instant sympathy.  Nobody ever bothers to look under gauze.  Ever.  If you get tired, just whip out that roll of gauze and use it as a pillow.  It\u2019s incredibly soft.  I\u2019m not even getting into its obvious uses as a bathroom helper.  You know what I mean.\n\n3. Business cards.  They don\u2019t have to say your name on them.  Mine don\u2019t.  Mine say a bunch of other people\u2019s names.  I just pick up a few every time I see a stack of them somewhere.  The point isn\u2019t to tell someone who you are, it\u2019s to tell them that you\u2019re a professional.  When you hand someone a business card, they know you mean business.  That\u2019s why they\u2019re called business cards.  \n\nMy toolkit comes in handy almost every day.  I don\u2019t go anywhere with it.

In actuality, Creed was being dragged through the forest by a one-armed yeti who was slobbering and sweating all over him.  It was pretty terrible.  Yeti sweat smells a lot like a petting zoo and that\u2019s exactly what Creed smelled like when he woke up.  He was lucky though, because if it wasn\u2019t for the smell, he might never have ever woken up at all.  Most yeti slaps prove to be fatal.\nCreed opened his eyes and looked around, wondering what strange place surrounded him.  He also wondered where he could find the petting zoo that smelled like it was close by.  Creed had always enjoyed petting llamas.  Creed sat in what appeared to be a row of seats inside a narrow tube of some sort.  It was very dark, but his eyes could make out several rows of seats in front of him.  His legs were cramped as there wasn\u2019t a lot of legroom for him to stretch out.  He stood up quickly and the pain of not moving his legs for hours attacked him like needles that sprouted from his leg like sharp grass.  Creed yelped and fell back into his seat.\nAll of a sudden, a door opened in front of Creed and the one-armed yeti emerged, but this time he was wearing a scarf and a pair of goggles.\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d asked Creed, his legs still smarting from standing up.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in my lair.  Well, my Lairplane, to be exact.  I live inside a small airplane,\u201d explained the yeti, who appeared much friendlier than before.\n\u201cWait.  Didn\u2019t you say before that you didn\u2019t talk?\u201d  Creed looked at him inquisitively.\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like talking before.  Most people don\u2019t question it.\u201d  The yeti looked upset and rightfully so.  He hated being questioned.\nThe yeti went on to explain that he lived inside the airplane because he used to be a pilot.  The plane used to be his, but it crashed in the forest many years ago and he had been living inside of it ever since.  Creed was fascinated by the yeti\u2019s stories, especially the ones about making friends with many of the forest creatures.  In the middle of one of the stories, a raccoon came into the airplane to ask the yeti a question.  Creed couldn\u2019t understand the raccoon because he couldn\u2019t talk to animals, but the yeti could.  Young Creed got to thinking that he could make a lot of money off of the yeti if he could capture it and turn it into an animal interpreter.  First, however, he had to find a way to capture it.\nTo Be Continued...\n**********************************************************************************************************************\n\n**********************************************************************************************************************\nCreed and the One-Armed Yeti Pilot\nPart Two\nThe One-Armed Yeti\u2019s Lair\n\nCreed and the One-Armed Yeti Pilot\nPart Two\nThe One-Armed Yeti\u2019s Lair\n\nFor what seemed like hours, Creed had been tripping out and thinking he was enjoying a fun day at a water park, splashing and running around.

I was a seahorse broad living in this underground suburban housing community and I was making dinner for my little seahorse kids until my husband came home and said he was taking us all for a seahorse celebration because he got promoted at the real estate office.

Last month, I only ate watermelon seeds and bacon fat.  This month, I\u2019m thinking of trying out a squirrel diet: acorns, berries, assorted tree leaves, and, of course, squirrel.  I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.\nThe real secret to my success is my workout regimen.  I do all my lifting in the office at night after everyone leaves.  First I start with my sit-downs.  I stand up and sit down on my chair twenty-five times or until I can\u2019t whistle.  Then I move over to the break room to do my patented Vending Machine Push.  It\u2019s real simple \u2013 just tip the vending machine towards you and push it towards the wall without letting it actually tip back onto its base.  I\u2019ll do this until I feel like I\u2019m going to die.  Then I do two more and slam that puppy back against the wall.  The Vending Machine Push actually has two purposes.  It makes your chest flat like Heston\u2019s in Ben-Hur and you get a lot of free snacks because they rattle loose when you\u2019re doing all the pushing.  It\u2019s the most valuable part of my workout.  I usually finish up by doing sprints through the kitchen, but last week some numbnuts spilled coffee on the floor and I took a pretty nasty tumble.  I was really pissed until I remembered that I was the one who spilled the coffee.  Let that be a lesson to us all: don\u2019t fall into traps you set for your co-workers.\n\nEvery month or so, I\u2019ll invent a new diet for myself that I stick to for about a week.

Once in a while you\u2019ll find a drummer who embodies everything that is rock and rock, but most of the time those guys flame out real fast (I miss you, Moonie).  Bottom line: make sure whomever you pick can count to four and hold his liquor.\nKeyboardists\nIf you put a keyboardist in your band, I will personally kick your ass no matter how old I am.

I\u2019m calling it \u201cWhat I Look for in a President\u201d because I keep hearing all kinds of buzzing about Presidents and elections and blacks and ladies and Mormons and short guys.  I don\u2019t follow the news, but I use newspapers for lots of other purposes so it kind of just soaks in.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been through lots of Presidents in my time and after a while, you get a sense of what you want in a leader.  Here\u2019s my list of what I look for in a President:\n\n1.\tI want a President who likes to dance.  You get a square up there and none of the other countries want to party.  The key to international relations is dancing.\n\n2.\tMy President needs to get pissed.  Too many of those stiffs get to the White House and glad-hand everyone.  Somebody does something terrible to America, they sit there calmly in their football-shaped office and tell us that everything is going to be okay.  I want a dude (or dudette) who grabs a golf club and smashes things when they talk to the nation.  I want a leader who\u2019s not afraid to tell everyone to go to hell.\n\n3.\tI want a President that looks good dressed up.  Nice cheeks bones are an added bonus.\n\n4.\tIf they\u2019re going to make bad decisions, they better make up for them spectacularly.  I\u2019m talking personalized apology notes, public floggings, and free ice cream.  If they want to sit in a dunk tank, I\u2019ll be the first in line to take a shot.  \n\n5.\tI want at least three controversies, none of which make America look bad.  The President getting caught with an unbelievably foxy hooker is okay, but the President getting caught hitting the foxy hooker is not.  Selling weapons to Europe is fine, but selling weapons to Asia is not.  I\u2019ll also accept some kind of unintentional foreign insult controversy, but it has to be funny and not boring.\n\n\nLook, it\u2019s not like I vote or anything.  I\u2019m just sharing my guidelines for good leadership.  You should probably figure out what you look for in a President on your own because it\u2019s good for democracy blah blah blah.  Hopefully next November, if I\u2019m still in America, whoever gets voted in will hit all five of my criteria.  If not, I can always move to Saskatchewan.  I hear Regina\u2019s nice."

I had a dream once about being in the middle of a pi\u00f1ata festival and I\u2019ve been waiting for it to come true.  Lord knows I love hard candy.\n\n\nSadly, it wasn\u2019t a pi\u00f1ata festival.  I can\u2019t say I was surprised though.  I\u2019ve been hoping for it for so long that I don\u2019t even get disappointed anymore.  I just accept the fact that one day, when I least expect it, I\u2019m going to walk into a giant auditorium and people are going to be popping colorful papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 burros and swimming in delicious hard candy. \n\n\nInstead of a pi\u00f1ata festival, I found a varsity girls\u2019 basketball game.  I almost walked right out, but the game drew me in like a tractor beam.  I was hooked right away.  Those elegant ladies were taking the game back to its fundamentals without any of the flash or razzle-dazzle that the boys play with these days.  It was a thing of beauty.  Every pass, every shot, every dribble \u2013 I felt like I was watching a symphony: A symphony of overly tall girls making the most of their awkward height. \n\nI stayed for the entire game.  When it was all over, I was so fired up that I got in the high-five line with both teams.  Some of the spectators thought it was strange, but most everyone thought I was somebody\u2019s senile grandfather so they just smiled and laughed.  You\u2019d be amazed at the things I can do because people assume I\u2019m senile, but the joke\u2019s on them because I\u2019m nowhere close to senile yet. \n\nThat one game showed me that grace and style and raw emotion have not disappeared from the sporting world.  If you ask me, high school girls\u2019 basketball is where it\u2019s at. \n\n\nInstead of a pi\u00f1ata festival, I found a varsity girls\u2019 basketball game.

My buddy Gerson found this great abandoned house over in Honesdale and he\u2019s been squatting there for the past month.  It\u2019s one of the best squat-houses I\u2019ve ever seen -- four bedrooms, working plumbing, only a few raccoons.  If you get the electricity turned on, that house becomes a home in an instant and on top of that, you\u2019ve already got pets.\n\nSquatting can go one of two ways: it can be really great or it can be horrible \u2013 truly, truly horrible.  I\u2019ve been in both situations.  Sometime in the late seventies (or was it early eighties?), I found my way into an abandoned factory on the eastern shore of Maryland and thought I was going to have the time of my life.  I hadn\u2019t seen a place that cool since the Playboy Club in Chicago and I was going to make it mine.  What I didn\u2019t know was that the factory was abandoned because it was slowly sinking into the Chesapeake Bay.

I was cruising around on a moped when I found this ranch house in Wilkes-Barre where the snow had piled up all over the driveway, so I knew it was deserted.  I went inside and it was like finding a little slice of heaven, complete with a full wet bar and a somewhat fresh Christmas tree.  Anyway, I was living there for a little while when I found out the house wasn\u2019t abandoned at all.  I suppose that explained all the food in the fridge.  When the family came home after a week, I planned on moving out, I really did, but I had already gotten into a routine and the house was kind of perfect for me, so I decided to stick around and see if I could make it work around their schedule.  As it turned out, the family was out of the house by eight every morning anyway, so I could do as I pleased.\n\nOne day, about a month into my squatting, I accidentally fell asleep in the tub.  Ray, the man of the house, caught me and kicked me out.  I learned an important lesson that day:  if you\u2019re squatting, take a shower.  Nobody falls asleep in the shower.  Taking baths, however, just sets you up for failure.  I cherish that month with the Fullers, though.  It really reminded me what it was like to have a family.  I still visit them sometimes \u2013 they don\u2019t know it, but I spent last weekend with them.  Great turkey chili, Mrs. F!

They\u2019d whoop \u2018em.\n\n\nWhen I was little, I took the cover off a baseball and made it into a hat for my schnauzer.\n\n\nI hear the Cubs still haven\u2019t won the World Series.  Let that be a lesson to everyone: That\u2019s what you get for making love to a goat in center field.\n\n\nWhen will baseball teams learn?  If you want your league to survive, you\u2019ve got to have cheerleaders.  I\u2019m sorry to say this, but I don\u2019t know how long baseball\u2019s going to be around if they don\u2019t get their act together.  Let the ladies cheer!\n\n\nI went through a stretch a few years back where I wore batting gloves to work because my hands were so slippery.  I was wearing special deodorant at the time because I tend to sweat a lot and it made the sweat come out of my palms instead of my pits.  The batting gloves helped out, but with all the moisture, they ended up smelling like death and who likes to be reminded of that?  I donated them to the Baseball Hall of Fame and took it as a write-off.\n\n\nI\u2019m giving thirty to one odds on Cincinnati for the Series this year.  Let me know if you\u2019re interested.\n\n\nHow\u2019s this for a slogan for Major League Baseball: \u201cBaseball: We\u2019re just like the other sports you like, but we play more games and the score\u2019s a lot lower.\u201d  I\u2019m going to make t-shirts.

I didn\u2019t agree.  I ordered her another and put it on some pilot\u2019s tab.  That skinny bartender saw her drinking it and tried to kick her out, but I said hell no and threw my glass at the wall.  At the same time, the dumb pilot noticed someone had been piling up drinks on his tab and that got him pretty steamed.  So here I am, with the bartender yelling at me, the pilot yelling at the bartender and LaDonna whispering \u201cmess \u2018em up real good\u201d into my ear.  So I did what I had to.  I took out a smoke bomb I smuggled back from China, threw that sucker on the floor and made a break for it with LaDonna.  Now that\u2019s love.\n\nWhen she got locked up, I went a little nutso.  Wrote her name all over my body with a permanent marker.  It didn\u2019t help me feel any better and I got some kind of ink poisoning, but once I got out of the hospital, I felt like I could deal with it better.  She made me promise never to visit her in the clink and I agreed.  Nobody wants to see visitors when they\u2019re in a cage.  We wrote letters, though.  Long, intimate letters where we invented a new kind of kama sutra.  You should see the one she called the dangling moose.  It was sexy as all hell.\n\nI\u2019m going to miss LaDonna a lot, but lucky for me I\u2019ve got the perfect cure for break-ups: half a bottle of Jack, six jalapeno poppers, and an unauthorized biography of Elizabeth Taylor.

After that, I'll spray paint all the windows in her booth black and show her why they call me \"The Guiding Principle.\"  It's going to be smooth.  Don\u2019t know if she\u2019s rich, but she definitely has access to a lot of change and that\u2019s good enough for me. \n\n\nThere\u2019re only six things you need if you want to snag a good woman:  A guitar, chicken, wine, a car, running water, and some permanent markers.  If you don\u2019t have a guitar, a lute will do.  You get those six things and you\u2019re Don Juan, trust me. "

Just a few observations on the world around me.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think is the best kind of car?  To me, you can\u2019t beat motorcycles.  They\u2019re small, and dangerous.\n\n\nI got into a car accident yesterday and I just took off.  It didn\u2019t look too bad.  The guy was making a big deal out of it, but come on \u2013 dogs don\u2019t live forever.\n\n\nSometimes when I\u2019m sick, or feeling blue, I drink vinegar.  I like all kinds: balsamic, vodka, orange juice, leaves.\n\n\nWorking in an office is fine, but I\u2019d rather be a millionaire.  [Elaborate on this.  It\u2019s interesting.  Maybe Trademark it, too.]\n\n\nToday in my office where I work as Director of Quality Assurance, we went to the beach for some reason that was never adequately explained.  When we were there, our manager told us to eat hot coals.  I thought that was a little bit untoward so I ate a fish.  Then a woman I have literally never seen before in my entire life started talking very loudly about something involving Halpert.  She was agitated, I\u2019d say.  From what I could guess, she was definitely on drugs of some kind, perhaps cocaine, or maybe \u2018drines.  Also, she is a knock-out.  She reminds me of a young Daphne Du Maurier.  Also, I stupidly ate the fishbones.  I told myself \u201cnever again\u201d after the last time, but then you turn around, and bam, they\u2019re in my mouth.  I also ate 55 hot dogs in 15 minutes, which is a world record.\n\n\nEverybody remembers: \u201cApril showers bring May flowers.\u201d  But no one remembers how the rest of that goes.  Which I find so frustrating.\n\n\nPrediction: the Orioles will win the World Series over the Pirates in seven games.\n\nPrediction: the space program will be renamed the Outer Space Program by 2060.\n\nPrediction: someday we will be able to travel faster than sound.  We will \u201cbreak the sound barrier.\u201d\n\nPrediction: [note \u2013 need more predictions.]\n\n\nReminder: Michael\u2019s safe combo: 26-32-20.\n"
