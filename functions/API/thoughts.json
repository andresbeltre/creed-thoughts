    "content": "Boy do I have a story to tell.  You know how I was keeping track of Michael\u2019s safe combo?  Well it finally came in handy.  I was trolling around the office last night after hours and heard some noise coming from the boss\u2019s room.  Normally the office is real quiet at night, which is why I stick around in the first place.  Quiet is like a drug to me and if I don\u2019t get my fix every night, I start to get the shakes.  \n\nSo anyway, I heard these noises and got freaked out that the bossman was using his office for a little nighttime nooky with that new chick that sits in Tony\u2019s seat every day.  Not wanting to get caught, I dropped down and started to army crawl over to investigate (I got a Private Investigator license so I\u2019m allowed to investigate anything I want, suckers).  As luck would have it, there wasn\u2019t anybody in there.  Turns out that the noise was coming from inside Michael\u2019s big furniture cabinet thing.  So I opened the cabinet door, half expecting a cat to jump out at me.  Usually when I open cabinets or closets or anything, cats end up pouncing on me.  For some reason, cats find me very attractive.\n\nNothing jumped out at me, but I could hear the rustling pretty close to the ground, so I bent over and figured out that it was coming from the safe.  For a second, I just stared at it, wondering what could be inside.  Then I realized that I had been saving up Michael\u2019s safe combo for this very occasion.  Well, this occasion and whenever I needed some cash, but that\u2019s beside the point.  \n\nI went over to my computer and looked back at my previous entries of this thing.  Apparently I wasn\u2019t too good with my record keeping because the numbers were kind of off.  I ended up trying out every combo I wrote down and you know what?  I didn\u2019t get it right until the very last one I tried.  The good news is, I got it open and you\u2019ll never guess what was inside.\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t a cat, smart ass.  It was a squirrel!  I don\u2019t know for the life of me why that guy had a squirrel in his safe, but I do know that I got me a new pet.  And I\u2019m going to train it.  Right now I\u2019m calling it Butthead, but I\u2019m open to suggestions for new names if you got any.  In just a few months, I\u2019m going to have the best trained squirrel in Pennsylvania.  I\u2019m also going to blackmail Michael because I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s against the law to lock a squirrel in a safe.  False imprisonment or something.\n\nEverything\u2019s coming up Creed!"

    "content": "I want to say I was about four years old when I fell in love with music.  My memory\u2019s not great, so it could have been anywhere between four and fourteen, but I think it was closer to four.  I was hanging out in an old abandoned car factory in South Carolina and I came across a bunch of old bumpers lying on the ground.  At that age, I used to walk around with a bunch of sticks in my back pocket in case I ever needed something to throw.  When I saw those bumpers, I don\u2019t know what came over me, but I knew that I had to take out a pair of sticks and start banging away.\n\nFrom the instant my sticks hit that metal, I was hooked.  I pounded out beat after beat, dancing and singing along.  I loved it.  The music jumped into my body like a venereal disease from a hooker.  I stayed in that factory for hours and hours just banging away.  The next day, I came back and started right up where I left off.  I made up songs about everything: jump ropes, corn, beaver skin hats.  Nothing was off limits.\n\nAbout a week later, I saw an old man playing a beat-up guitar on the street.  I watched him for a while, trying to learn what he was doing as I stood there.  After about an hour, he said he had to go to the can and asked me to watch his instrument.  I gladly agreed.  When he left to go to the bathroom, I snatched the guitar and ran all the way to the factory.  It was the first thing I had ever stolen and on that day, I said to myself \u201cMusic and thieving are going to be the biggest things in your life\u201d and you know what?  They still are.\n\nMusic has been a part of me ever since.  Not a day goes by where I don\u2019t tap out a rhythm or pick up my axe and play a lick or two.  If you cut open my veins, I\u2019m fairly certain that quarter notes would come tumbling out.  I can\u2019t imagine my life without music and I don\u2019t want to.  "

I go for the air conditioning and the smell.  Libraries smell good.  It almost makes me want to like books, but not quite.  Anyway, there\u2019re a lot of kids at the library -- maybe it\u2019s summer school or something \u2013 and these kids talk like I\u2019ve never heard before.  It\u2019s like a secret street language and I want in.  They say stuff like \u201cthat dude got clowned\u201d and \u201che got that swag when he walks.\u201d I want to know what the hell these kids are talking about, but they won\u2019t tell me.  I\u2019ve tried going up to the kids to talk about the phrases, but they get kind of freaked out by me.  Just wait until they need an ID \u2013 then we\u2019ll see who\u2019s running away and telling the librarians.\n\nAnyway, those jerks won\u2019t tell me anything, so I\u2019m making up my own words and phrases.  This is my street dictionary and I\u2019m not even charging for it.  Just don\u2019t tell the kids in the library, okay?\n\nKeep it bowlin\u2019 \u2013 Everyone likes bowling, so this is a phrase for when you want to tell someone to stay positive.  For example, if someone tells you they lost their job, you can just tell them to keep it bowlin\u2019 and that\u2019ll cheer them up.\n\nPloppers \u2013 This means bad.  \u201cDid you see that movie last night?  It was ploppers.\u201d\n\nHorribly obese \u2013 I\u2019m taking this one from the library kids.  They say things are fat all the time, so I took it a step further.  In this case, it means the most beautiful ever.  If a foxy dame comes walking in, you can call her horribly obese.  I think it might take some time before it catches on, so use this one with caution because some broads may not have heard it yet and could take it the wrong way.\n\nWilly fingers \u2013 Perhaps the hardest to explain, but you get willy fingers when you really want to fight someone.  \u201cWhen my boss was yelling at me, I really started getting willy fingers.\u201d  Your fingers start moving real fast and itching because they want to hit something \u2013 that\u2019s the willy fingers.\n\nThose kids are going to regret not letting me in on their lingo.  My slang\u2019s going to take over the nation and there\u2019s nothing those idiots can do to stop it.  Keep it bowlin\u2019, people."

That\u2019s my favorite part about work parties \u2013 they end up saving me a lot of moolah in the long run.  I wish they were more fun, though.  If I was in charge, we\u2019d be rocking and rolling all night.  My parties would go down in history as the best work parties of all time.  Here\u2019s a rundown of my perfect party:\n\nWe\u2019d start out with a bang, and by that I mean I\u2019d fire off a starter\u2019s pistol so people knew the party actually started.  The very first event of the party would be Bobbing for Creed Shots.  I\u2019d fill a large kiddie pool with Creed Juice -- a mixture of kool-aid, Pop Rocks, and grain alcohol -- and throw some shot glasses in there.  Then everyone has to lean in, grab a shot glass with their mouths, and take the shot.  It\u2019s messy but it sure gets things started right.  If you\u2019re not drunk after Bobbing for Creed Shots, you\u2019re not playing right.\n\nSo after everyone\u2019s good and sauced up, I\u2019d break out the pi\u00f1atas.  The key to pi\u00f1atas at parties is naming them.  If you name them after co-workers, you know people are going to really get into it.  I\u2019m not so great with names, so I\u2019d let somebody else do the naming, but trust me, they would all be named.  As for filling them, that all depends on the budget.  If there\u2019s no dinero for the pi\u00f1atas, then I\u2019d fill them with dry rice.  If there\u2019s a little cash around, then I\u2019d go for hard candy.  With hard candy, you get the fun of seeing the pi\u00f1ata burst AND the injuries that go with it.\n\nAfter pi\u00f1ata time, we\u2019d go straight into the eating contests.  I\u2019m partial to deviled eggs for quantity, but I know hot dogs are pretty popular these days, too.  I\u2019d compromise and make hot dog omelets for everyone to scarf down.  I\u2019m pretty sure I know who\u2019d win, but you never can tell \u2013 sometimes the smallest accountants make the biggest eaters.\n\nWhen the party winds down, I\u2019d do another round of Bobbing for Creed Shots and then send people on their way with Goody Bags.  The bags would just be filled with office supplies, but hey, everyone likes a parting gift, right?\n\nThey should really make me head of that party committee thing.  I\u2019d be amazing."

Sure, they have a 99% chance of knowing that you\u2019re not Batman, but it\u2019s that 1% that gives you the in.\n\nWhat you\u2019re really looking for is the lady that wants to argue with you about how much you\u2019re not Batman.  Those are the broads that end up in bed with you later on yelling \u201cYes, Batman!  Show me your utility belt!\u201d  It works every time.  It also helps to have a utility belt with you because up until that point, she may still not believe you\u2019re Batman, but when you produce the utility belt, you send her head spinning.\n\nI never used to be good at pick-up lines because I was too direct.  \u201cI\u2019d like to be your blanket\u201d works on some chicks, but most of them just slap you and walk away.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a good slapping.  It\u2019s good for the skin and makes you focus on the task at hand.  I\u2019d just rather talk to the woman than get slapped, that\u2019s all.  So I had to take a different approach.  I\u2019ve heard of new dating advice books where you\u2019re supposed to insult a girl to get her attention, but I think that\u2019s the wrong approach.  If I\u2019m not pretending to be Batman, I like to use really impressive facts to get them to talk to me.\n\nI\u2019ll pick out the hottest lady in the bar (or zoo or botanical garden or wherever else I might happen to be) and get her attention with a really loud whisper.  Women respond really well to whispers.  It\u2019s because they like secrets.  So I\u2019ll whisper, \u201cHey you, come over here\u201d and I\u2019ll look like I\u2019ve got a real big secret to tell them.  When they come over, I reach into my bag of facts (not literally) and pull out a good one.  \u201cDolphins are the only animals besides humans that copulate for pleasure.\u201d  It works like a charm.  Most of the time.  Not really.  It gets me slapped less, though, so I\u2019m sticking with it."

    "content": "One of my great joys in life is going to the car wash.  Some people may think of it as a hassle, just another chore in their already over-chored lives, but not me.  The car wash for me is a wonderful place.  It\u2019s where you go to get a new lease on life, or at least a new lease on your scooter.  I\u2019m not talking about actual leases \u2013 I have no idea how to get a new lease on a scooter.  I won mine in a fight.  I\u2019m talking about that feeling when you bring in your scooter all caked in mud and whatever other junk might be stuck on there and you ride off with a shiny new-looking scooterino.  That\u2019s satisfaction. \n\nYou might not have a scooter.  You might have a car: the more \u201ctraditional\u201d vehicle to take to a car wash.  I\u2019m a proud scooter owner and as a proud scooter owner, I like to keep my scooter clean.  After all, dirt really shows up on red plastic, you know?  So once every month or so in the summer, I take a trip to the place on Moosic and get my wheels all soaped up.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe the feeling I get at the car wash without sounding dirty (not that that\u2019s ever stopped me before), but I\u2019ll try.  It feels a little bit like I\u2019m in the hospital getting a sponge bath from some real foxy nurses.  Replace hospital with car wash and real foxy nurses with real burly joes and that\u2019s pretty much what the experience is like.  I love to see them get down and dirty with my little scooter.  Wipe it down and rinse it off and put so much care into the job.  When it comes out of there all gleaming and clean, I feel like I need a smoke.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not a real extravagant guy.  I pick fights with extravagant guys.  But the car wash is the one place where I can throw down eight bucks once a month and feel like a king.

It takes place on June 20th and it is a sight to behold.  America Day was created by a friend of mine named Samuel Che Emanuel.  He\u2019s rail-thin with a haircut that looks oddly as if a woman had her hair cut short like a man.  It\u2019s hard to describe, but it\u2019s a feminine masculine haircut, if that makes sense to anyone.  He\u2019s a real sparkplug of a guy.  Grew up in the wilderness of Colorado with a pet bear.

People called me Captain Crapstick because of how I dressed and the fact that I would carry around a stick with me that I used for poking all sorts of crap.  I still have my sailor suit hanging proudly in my closet, but I only break it out when a special lady comes over.  It doesn\u2019t fit so well anymore, but I still look darn cute in it.\n\nIn my opinion, every job should have a uniform.  Fast-food workers, gas station attendants, exterminators, these guys all have it covered already.  I\u2019m pushing for the jobs that make you waste time every morning decided what to wear.  Take my job, for instance.  I know I\u2019m not allowed to wear shorts, because every time I do, I get yelled at.  I also can\u2019t wear vests without shirts underneath.  So I\u2019m locked into wearing a certain combination of clothing every day, but there are just too many choices.  If it were up to me, I\u2019d implement an office worker uniform so you could just wake up every morning, go to your uniform closet, and three seconds later you\u2019re all set.\n\nMy uniform would consist of three items and three items only.  \n\n1. Navy blue sweatpants.  These are the first item because they\u2019re the most important.  When I go home, the first thing I do is put on navy blue sweatpants.  You can\u2019t find a more comfortable piece of clothing.  The color is great because you can spill all you want and nobody\u2019s the wiser.  All in all, if the uniform doesn\u2019t include navy blue sweatpants, I don\u2019t want the job. \n\n2. A vest.  No shirt required.  Vests are amazing inventions.  They cover up your nipples (which society has decided are unacceptable to see, for some reason) and they\u2019re classy.  You want to class up a joint?  Throw on a vest.  You want to add some more class?  Make sure that vest is leather.\n\n3. Comfy slippers.  Right after I change into my navy blue sweatpants, I slide on my sheepskin-lined slippers.  Talk about comfort!  These little puppies make it feel like you\u2019re walking on a field of soft paralyzed sheep \u2013 I say paralyzed only so you don\u2019t picture the sheep as moving.  If I could wear slippers to work every day, I\u2019d probably start caring about my job.\n\nThese three items could change the workplace as we know it.  I\u2019m serious, America.  Just think about how much more productive we would be as a country if all office-workers wore navy blue sweatpants, vests without shirts, and comfy slippers.  We\u2019d be a comfortably dressed productivity superpower, and honestly, isn\u2019t that what all this fighting is about anyway?"

Start a little seat orchestra and you\u2019ll be sent home in no time.  I wish I were back in my twenties when I couldn\u2019t smell anything because then I\u2019d have some fun with these stinkbombs.  Sadly, every time I let one go, I\u2019m my own first victim.\n\nI end up being victim to myself a lot.  That\u2019s what happens when you do a lot of home chemical mixing.  It started out as a hobby, but I\u2019ve really stepped up my game in the last few years.  I\u2019m trying to find a chemical cure for wrinkles, but it\u2019s not going so well.  I have, however, invented quite a few potions for giving yourself rashes.  When rashes come back into \u201cvogue,\u201d I\u2019ll be the king of the rash world.\n\nRash World sounds like a really fun theme park, don\u2019t you think?  I\u2019d visit, as long as the admission price wasn\u2019t too high.  I wonder if they have funnel cakes at Rash World.  Funnel cakes are incredible.  They\u2019re my favorite fried batter-based cake.\n\nOther types of cakes that I enjoy: snack cakes, birthday cakes, coffee cakes, tea cakes, ice cream cakes, urinal cakes, erotic cakes, layer cakes, hot cakes, and wedding cakes.  Cakes that I do not enjoy: cupcakes.  Why waste my time on a cupcake when I can get the real deal?  Cupcakes should only be eaten in times of war or famine.  Or when they\u2019re filled with cream.  That\u2019s it."

Who can afford to drink more than one a day?  Certainly not me.  My money goes to more enterprising pursuits, like laminating equipment and buying ladies drinks.  I wish I could drink six or seven cans of the stuff a day to keep me going, but until I win the lottery, that\u2019s not happening.  When I was in the convenience store the other day, though, I saw this new energy drink called VivaMaxxPlus, so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nLet me tell you, that stuff is amazing.  They\u2019re half the price of the Bull and they get my heart going even faster.  It\u2019s incredible.  I drink a whole mess of them at lunchtime and then I\u2019m awake until the sun comes up.  It really helps me get through the workday and then my real workday, which starts at around 10pm.  It\u2019s hard to explain the feeling I get, but it\u2019s like someone hooked up a battery to my body and it\u2019s in charge of making my blood flow, but the dial that controls the speed got messed up and it\u2019s stuck on \u201csuper fast.\u201d  That\u2019s exactly what it feels like.

I started imagining me and her on a go-kart track, but she didn\u2019t have a go-kart and my go-kart had all kinds of James Bond spy weapons on it.  Right when I started picturing myself shooting her with my dashboard missiles, I realized I needed to take it down a notch.

I think the boss man broke out his brass knuckles because I saw a lot of blood on the carpet the next day.  Blood on the carpet means trouble \u2013 that\u2019s a rule I live by.  I don\u2019t like fights at work, because it\u2019s too many parts of my life coming together in one place.  I prefer to keep fighting outside of work and my work out of fights.  This fight turned out pretty well for me, though, because everyone else got sent home so they could have a private cage match.\n\nThe first thing I did when we got sent home was head straight over to the mall for some orange chicken at the Lotus place.  That stuff is dynamite.  I could eat a shopping cart full of it.  Sadly, they don\u2019t sell it by the shopping cart, no matter how often I ask them to, so I settled for a combo meal.  There were a few high school kids in the food court, so I tried to drum up some new customers for my novelty identification and lamination business.  They weren\u2019t interested.  Apparently there\u2019s some punk over at Scranton Prep who does a really good Delaware now.  Even better than my Georgia.  I\u2019m going to track that kid down and have a \u201ctalk\u201d with him.  When it comes to novelty identification and lamination, I need to be the only game in town.\n\nAfter the mall, I was pretty riled up, so I headed over to that \u201cJust Paint It\u201d place where you can paint your own pottery.  That place is like a zen garden to me.  I just sit down, grab a small ceramic elephant and go to town.  I can zone out for two, three hours painting that thing.  The best part about it is that when I\u2019m done, I get to take it with me.  You\u2019d be surprised how much you can get for an orange and green elephant when you tell people it\u2019s imported from Indonesia.\n\nI spent the rest of the night over at the grocery store sampling the candy in the bulk bins.

I found a dog that looked just like Bozo wandering around Wilkes-Barre over the weekend by herself and I immediately snatched her up.  You might think it\u2019s cruel to snatch a dog, but I say it\u2019s the only way.  I got a real big sack with breathing holes cut all over it and then I coaxed her to walk into it by throwing about fifteen hot dogs in there.  Once she was in the sack, I took her home with me and we\u2019ve been best friends ever since.  I\u2019ve been thinking about fitting her for a saddle since she\u2019s kind of big and I\u2019ve been meaning to start a doggy ride business for carnivals anyway.\n\nDoggy rides were one of my favorite childhood pastimes.  Pony rides and elephant rides seem to be the most popular form of animal rides, but doggy rides are a lot more fun.  They\u2019re like those mini-motorcycles that crazy idiots buy these days.  With a doggy ride, you never know where you\u2019re going to end up: The dogs might take off like jack-rabbits when they see something or the dogs could just plop down and take a rest.  We used to call those Sitsies.  You could never get a refund for a Sitsie, but you\u2019d always get a rain check.\n\nMy first step in dog ownership is training.  I\u2019ve already trained my pooch to relax, bark at the doorbell, and drink water.  Pretty soon we\u2019re going to work on pee in the house and growl.  She\u2019s super smart, so she\u2019s been picking everything up so quickly.  I really want to teach her to give me haircuts, but I\u2019ve had bad luck giving animals hair clippers recently.\n\nPicking a name is the most important part of getting a new dog.  With a girl dog, you\u2019ve got a few ways to go.  You can call her a traditional feminine name, like Molly or Annabelle, you can name her something that relates to the way she looks like Blackhead or Furry Paws, or you can name her based on something you really like.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling my dog \u201cHot.\u201d  I love hot dogs.  Always have, even in my vegetarian days.  Now that I have my own little hot dog running around with me, I\u2019ll be constantly reminded of her sausage-y goodness.  If you see Hot and me taking a stroll, come on over and say hi, but watch out.  I\u2019m in the middle of training her to bite strangers."

The kits got whatever tools they need to get their jobs done \u2013 hammers, screwdrivers, jaws of life, etc.  As a guy that doesn\u2019t build things or fix things, you might think that I don\u2019t need a toolkit, but you\u2019d be wrong.  I have my own kit that I carry around with me every day and I\u2019ve pared it down over the years to just the bare essentials.  \n\n1. Nail clippers.  I don\u2019t know about you, but my nails grow crazy fast.  That\u2019s not even why I carry the clippers, though.  Clippers are great when you need to cut something, like a wire or a chain, and you don\u2019t want to be seen carrying something bigger.  Sure, they\u2019re not the strongest things in the world, but trust me, they get the job done.  Not only that, but they provide a great cover for anything you\u2019re doing.  Let\u2019s say, hypothetically, that you\u2019re trying to get in somewhere you\u2019re not supposed to be and, all of a sudden, some fatso security guard comes walking through.  Do you freak out?  No way.  You just pull out your clippers and start clipping your nails.  Who are you?  Just a normal guy trying to work on his personal hygiene.  It\u2019s perfect.\n\n2. Gauze.  Gauze is a great accessory.  If you get hurt, put gauze on it.  If you want to make people think that you\u2019re hurt, wrap a little gauze anywhere on your body and boom \u2013 instant sympathy.  Nobody ever bothers to look under gauze.  Ever.  If you get tired, just whip out that roll of gauze and use it as a pillow.  It\u2019s incredibly soft.  I\u2019m not even getting into its obvious uses as a bathroom helper.  You know what I mean.\n\n3. Business cards.  They don\u2019t have to say your name on them.  Mine don\u2019t.  Mine say a bunch of other people\u2019s names.  I just pick up a few every time I see a stack of them somewhere.  The point isn\u2019t to tell someone who you are, it\u2019s to tell them that you\u2019re a professional.  When you hand someone a business card, they know you mean business.  That\u2019s why they\u2019re called business cards.  \n\nMy toolkit comes in handy almost every day.  I don\u2019t go anywhere with it.  Now that you know what\u2019s in my toolkit, I\u2019ve got to ask \u2013 what\u2019s in your toolkit?"

You\u2019ve got to be careful about who you put in your band, though, because if you get the wrong combination of rockers, you could be in for a lifetime of pain.  I made a little guide to help you out when you\u2019re choosing band members.\n\nGuitarists\nThese guys are the toughest to pick.  If you\u2019re a guitar player yourself, consider yourself lucky that you don\u2019t need to find one because these dudes have the biggest egos.  They\u2019re the ones who want to be front and center all the time.  They\u2019re the first ones buying the leather pants and they\u2019re the ones spitting whiskey fireballs at everyone after shows.  When you\u2019re finding a guitarist, look for one that says stuff like \u201cMaybe the drummer should be the singer,\u201d or \u201cSometimes I like to play with my back to the audience because I don\u2019t really like attention.\u201d  Trust me, he\u2019s going to work out a lot better than picking the guy that says he wants to dress up like a sexy astronaut at every gig.\n\n\n\nContinue reading \"Creed Thoughts\" \u00bb\n"

I\u2019m calling it \u201cWhat I Look for in a President\u201d because I keep hearing all kinds of buzzing about Presidents and elections and blacks and ladies and Mormons and short guys.  I don\u2019t follow the news, but I use newspapers for lots of other purposes so it kind of just soaks in.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been through lots of Presidents in my time and after a while, you get a sense of what you want in a leader.  Here\u2019s my list of what I look for in a President:\n\n1.\tI want a President who likes to dance.  You get a square up there and none of the other countries want to party.  The key to international relations is dancing.\n\n2.\tMy President needs to get pissed.  Too many of those stiffs get to the White House and glad-hand everyone.  Somebody does something terrible to America, they sit there calmly in their football-shaped office and tell us that everything is going to be okay.  I want a dude (or dudette) who grabs a golf club and smashes things when they talk to the nation.  I want a leader who\u2019s not afraid to tell everyone to go to hell.\n\n3.\tI want a President that looks good dressed up.  Nice cheeks bones are an added bonus.\n\n4.\tIf they\u2019re going to make bad decisions, they better make up for them spectacularly.  I\u2019m talking personalized apology notes, public floggings, and free ice cream.  If they want to sit in a dunk tank, I\u2019ll be the first in line to take a shot.  \n\n5.\tI want at least three controversies, none of which make America look bad.  The President getting caught with an unbelievably foxy hooker is okay, but the President getting caught hitting the foxy hooker is not.  Selling weapons to Europe is fine, but selling weapons to Asia is not.  I\u2019ll also accept some kind of unintentional foreign insult controversy, but it has to be funny and not boring.\n\n\nLook, it\u2019s not like I vote or anything.  I\u2019m just sharing my guidelines for good leadership.  You should probably figure out what you look for in a President on your own because it\u2019s good for democracy blah blah blah.  Hopefully next November, if I\u2019m still in America, whoever gets voted in will hit all five of my criteria.  If not, I can always move to Saskatchewan.  I hear Regina\u2019s nice."

At night, we\u2019d have Christmas Eve dinner with goose and stuffing and then we\u2019d go to bed, waiting for the whole thing to happen all over again.  I came up with this groovy creation story about Santa being a real man that arose from an elven tribe living among the polar ice caps.  People really seemed to dig it.

Also, I know a lot of people who are really into misdemeanor crimes.  Makes them feel alive.  So I want to make a special line of vending machine snacks based on people\u2019s favorite crimes.  They\u2019d be delicious, exciting, and fun for kids.\n\n\nContinue reading \"Creed Thoughts\" \u00bb\n"

Cops, security officers, DEA -- doesn\u2019t matter to me.  They\u2019re all foxy.  \n\n\nLove is tricky.  It makes you do crazy things.  Back in \u201973, I got into a love triangle.  Love pyramid, really.  Put $6,000 into a cigarette resale venture and just waited for the dough to start pouring in.  It never did.  Lost my savings for a shot with the DePalma sisters, but it was worth it.  I\u2019ve still got some old smokes sitting in a storage shed up in Delaware.  It\u2019s my little reminder of the price of love.\n\n\nContinue reading \"Creed Thoughts\" \u00bb\n"

I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s the kind of thing I can build a whole night around.  I stopped at the supermarket on the way home and picked up some things to get me in the mood:  Buffalo jerky, buffalo wings, Frosted Flakes, some cupcakes, and a bottle of white wine.  (Side note: I couldn\u2019t find any lion-related items at the store, so I settled for the Flakes because of the Tiger.  It was the best I could do.)  When I got home, I was really jazzed for a good old-fashioned jungle fight.  I turned on my computer and boom \u2013 nothing happened.  Just a weird clucking noise and a black screen, so I did what anybody would do.  I punched my computer and then I called tech support.\n\n\nContinue reading \"Creed Thoughts\" \u00bb\n"

I know what you\u2019re thinking and yes, they are wrinkled, but they\u2019re still strong.\n\n\nNumber One on my list of changes:  Pennsylvania should change its name to Transylvania.  Lots of idiots buy all kinds of vampire rings and vampire necklaces and garlic-flavored vampire gum.  There\u2019s a lot of dough to be made from these suckers and I\u2019m tired of seeing it go to foreigners.  If we change the name of the state, we can probably do away with property tax considering the amount of souvenirs we\u2019re going to sell.

When we were there, our manager told us to eat hot coals.  I thought that was a little bit untoward so I ate a fish.  Then a woman I have literally never seen before in my entire life started talking very loudly about something involving Halpert.  She was agitated, I\u2019d say.  From what I could guess, she was definitely on drugs of some kind, perhaps cocaine, or maybe \u2018drines.  Also, she is a knock-out.  She reminds me of a young Daphne Du Maurier.  Also, I stupidly ate the fishbones.  I told myself \u201cnever again\u201d after the last time, but then you turn around, and bam, they\u2019re in my mouth.  I also ate 55 hot dogs in 15 minutes, which is a world record.\n\n\nEverybody remembers: \u201cApril showers bring May flowers.\u201d  But no one remembers how the rest of that goes.
